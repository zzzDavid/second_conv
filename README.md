debugging difference


- `hcl`: HLS code generated by HeteroCL
- `hls`: manual HLS implementation
- `python`: python implementation


Found the issue:

`hls` assumes weights to be `(i, o, k, k)` format, while the other two uses `(o, i, k, k)`. `o` is output channel, `i` is input channel, `k` is kernel size.

Changing `hls` weight index calculation logic to `(o, i, k, k)` yields matching results.
